# Customer Segmentation Credit cards using clustering model
## Project Goal: assist in dividing credit card holders or potential customers into more homogeneous segments based on certain characteristics, such as spending behavior, income, credit history, and preferences

### Brief explanation of the project
Bank XYZ wants to carry out customer segmentation to make it easier to detect fraud, adjust products and services and other analysis. The data used is credit card usage information data for the last 6 months from XYZ bank. In carrying out segmentation, the method used is K-Means Clustering, namely grouping data into groups (clusters) based on the proximity of the data to the cluster centers. The results obtained are 4 different clusters according to certain characteristics.

### File:
- h8dsft_P1G4_AryWidanthi.csv contains data source used for clustering model that consist of 19 column ('CUST_ID', 'BALANCE', 'BALANCE_FREQUENCY', 'PURCHASES','ONEOFF_PURCHASES', 'INSTALLMENTS_PURCHASES', 'CASH_ADVANCE','PURCHASES_FREQUENCY', 'ONEOFF_PURCHASES_FREQUENCY','PURCHASES_INSTALLMENTS_FREQUENCY', 'CASH_ADVANCE_FREQUENCY','CASH_ADVANCE_TRX', 'PURCHASES_TRX', 'CREDIT_LIMIT', 'PAYMENTS','MINIMUM_PAYMENTS', 'PRC_FULL_PAYMENT', 'TENURE')and 4475 rows. 
- h8dsft_P1G4_AryWidanthi.ipynb is the file that consist of code for clustering model.

### Weaknesses and Strengths
Strength: Can identify 4 cluster of credit card user 
Weaknesses: Haven't create deployment
